# tf_cherry_class
Classify cherries varieties using experimental quality control parameters (TensorFlow PoC)

# How ?
I collected two years of quality report from a cherry manufacturing plant.
Data has been processed to remove faulty entries/miss placed information.
The dataset represents approximatly 4000 samples of cherry samples selected at the moment of arrival at the processing plant.
Each sample is made of 100 frut, of which we express firmness (durofel), color (5 colors range), brix (sugar level) and core temperature (Â°C).
The processing facility manage 20 varieties.
To be season-independent, I compiled together two years of quality reports (2018-2019).

# Result
